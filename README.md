Here we import a random module in python to and use a while statement and also use a counter that iterates when a user guesses correctly and gives the user the final number of gueses in which the user guessed the corrct number.

Quiz_game.py
Here we again use if statments to ask the user a question and compare it with the answers and give the user the output if the questions are correct or incorrect. We take all the input the user provied and convert it to lower case string and then match with the answers. We also give the user scores which iterates when the user provides the correct answer and finally give the percentage for the correct answers.
